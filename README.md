## Description
This GitHub repository contains a Django-based RESTful API that leverages a pre-trained ResNet deep learning model for image recognition. The API allows users to submit images and returns predictions and confidence scores for objects or subjects recognized within those images. It's an excellent example of integrating machine learning models into web applications.

## Key Features
    Utilizes Django, a robust Python web framework, for the backend.
    Incorporates a pretrained ResNet-50 model for image classification.
    Accepts image uploads via API requests or base64-encoded images.
    Provides predictions with confidence scores for recognized objects.
    Supports easy deployment to various hosting platforms.

## Usage
    Clone the repository to your local environment.
    Set up the Django project and install necessary dependencies.
    Run the Django development server.
    Use API endpoints to send images and receive predictions.

## Requirements
    Python
    Django
    TensorFlow/Keras
    Django REST framework
    PIL
